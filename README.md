# BunkersAndBadasses

This is an (ALPHA) unoficial Loot Generator for 2K and Nerdvana Games <a href="https://nerdvanagames.myshopify.com/">Bunkers and Badasses</a> TTRPG Game. 
All of the data has been painstakingly transcribed by hand from the Book, to avoid having to stop the game just to generate loot.
